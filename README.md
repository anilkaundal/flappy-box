# flappy-box
This is a computer graphics project, a 2D game which i have made for my course. DevC++ IDE, OpenGL programming & C++ programming language are used to build the project "Flappy Box" To run this project you need to add OpenGL's ancillary program to your DevC++ IDE. After that just need to open the .dev file with DevC++.
